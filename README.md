# ⚡ Cybersecurity Writeups

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio! This repository tracks my complete journey into ethical hacking, blue‑team skills, real-world labs, CTF writeups, and security projects.

Whether you're a recruiter, mentor, or fellow learner — this repo shows my progression, thought process, and hands-on work.

##  About This Repository

This repo is a living journal of my cybersecurity learning and practical work. Here I document:

* **HTB & TryHackMe module notes**
* **CTF writeups** (detailed, step-by-step)
* **Vulnerable machine walkthroughs**
* **Scripts, tools, and mini-projects I build**
* **Important cybersecurity theory and cheatsheets**
* **Labs & sandbox experiments**

My goal is to *learn publicly*, stay accountable, and build a solid technical portfolio.

##  CTF & HTB Writeups

Each writeup includes:

* 📝 **Problem summary**
* 🔍 **Thought process**
* 🛠 **Tools used**
* 🧠 **Key concepts learned**
* 🧰 **Alternative methods** (if any)
* 🎯 **Flag + verification**

> I DO NOT post flags directly from live machines — writeups are uploaded only after challenges are retired.

##  My Goals

### Short term

* Build strong fundamentals (Networking, Linux, Python, Web Sec)
* Solve 20+ CTF challenges
* Complete HTB Academy modules

### Long term

* Contribute actively to open-source security tools
* Build 5+ serious cybersecurity projects
* Achieve OSCP/CEH
* Become a professional penetration tester

##  Tools & Skills I'm Learning

* Kali, Parrot OS, Ubuntu
* Nmap, BurpSuite, Wireshark, Metasploit
* Python scripting
* Web app vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
* Privilege escalation
* Malware analysis basics

---

##  Projects Included (So far)

* **Malware Sandbox Lite:** Execute suspicious files in an isolated environment & analyze behavior.
* **Recon Automation Script:** Automates port scanning + service enumeration.
* **Log Analyzer:** Python tool for parsing logs & detecting anomalies.

(These will grow as I learn more.)

##  Why This Repo Exists

Cybersecurity learning is *not linear*. This repo exists to track progress and keep me accountable.

I believe in:

* **Learning in public**
* **Documenting everything**
* **Sharing knowledge openly**

If you're on the same journey — welcome! Let's grow together.
