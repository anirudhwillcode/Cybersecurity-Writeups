# Network Topologies

- A Network Topology is an arragement and physical or logical connection of devices in the network
- Computers are hosts, such as clients and servers, that actively use the network. They also include network components such as switches, bridges, and routers

- We can divide the entire network topology area into three areas:


1. Connections          
2. Nodes - Network Interface Controller ( NICs)
3. Classifications ( Point to Point , Star etc)


### 1 . Connections

### 2. Nodes (NIC)

**NIC = Network Interface Card**
*A Network Interface Card (NIC) is a hardware component—built-in or external—that allows a computer or device to connect to a network (LAN, Wi-Fi, internet, etc.).
It acts as the bridge between your device and the network by sending and receiving data.*

### 3. Classifications

1. Point to Point
2. Star
3. Mesh
4. Bus
5. Ring
6. Tree
7. Daisy Chain

#### 1 . Point to Point

- Simplest form of connection

#### 2 . Bus

- All Hosts are connected to a single transmission medium
- No central component that controls
- Only one host can send at a time

#### 3. Star

- Each host is connected to the central network component via a separate link

#### 4. Ring

#### 5. Mesh

- Each host is connected to every other host in the network in a fully meshed structure. This means that the hosts are meshed with each other. This technique is primarily used in WAN or MAN to ensure high reliability and bandwidth.

#### 6. Tree
